		<h2> MARTIAL LAW </h2>
<center><img src="pro.jpg" alt="img" height="auto" width="400px"></center>
			<p> Proclamation The Philippines was under Martial Law when Ferdinand Marcos signed the Proclamation No. 1081 on September 21, 1972. All through the Martial Law time frame, Marcos developed the clique of September 21, broadcasting it as National Thanksgiving Day by virtue of Proclamation No. 1180 s. 1973 to memorialize the date as the establishment day of his New Society. The publicity exertion was successful to the point that up to the present, numerous Filipinos—especially the individuals who did not survive the occasions of September 23, 1972—work under the confusion that military law was announced on September 21, 1972. It wasn’t. On September 21, 1972, democracy was all the while working in the Philippines. Senator Benigno S. Aquino Jr. was as yet ready to convey a benefit discourse—what might be his last one—in the Senate. Primitivo Mijares, among others, related the working of the House of Representatives and the Senate, with board gatherings booked for that night. Senate and House pioneers concurred not to dismiss on this day, as prior planned. They chose to extend their unique session to a sine die adjournment on September 23. </p>
			<p> That afternoon, a dissent walk in Plaza Miranda was supported by the Concerned Christians for Civil Liberties. The rally was gone to by more than 30 "civic, religious, labor, student, and activist groups […] [and] a crowd of 30,000," and got scope from daily papers, radio, and TV. Marcos wrote in his diary that he, together with individuals from his Cabinet and staff, completed the arrangement of Proclamation 1081 at 8 PM, September 21. A day after the last discourse of Ninoy Aquino, daily papers still turned out: they highlighted the rally held the earlier day in Plaza Miranda. Mijares recounted that Marcos was unsettled by an announcement revealed in the Daily Express that if Martial Law were proclaimed, Aquino said he would need to be captured not long after or he would escape to join the resistance. </p>
			<p> September 21 or 23? </p>
			<p> At the point when Marcos showed up on TV at 7:15 p.m. on September 23, 1972 to declare that he had put the "whole Philippines under Martial Law" by prudence of Proclamation No. 1081, he surrounded his declaration in legalistic terms that were false. This covered the genuine way of his demonstration right up 'til the present time: it was nothing not as much as a self-overthrow. Marcos reported that he had set the whole nation under Martial Law starting at 9 p.m. on September 22, 1972 by means of a declaration which, he guaranteed, he'd marked on September 21, 1972. Marcos' fixation on numerology (especially the number seven) required that Proclamation No. 1081 be authoritatively marked out on a date that was distinct by seven. Along these lines, September 21, 1972 turned into the official date that Martial Law was set up and the day that the Marcos autocracy started. This likewise enabled Marcos to control history all alone terms. </p>

		<h2> MARTIAL LAW AND THE MILITARY</h2>
<center><img src="mi.jpg" alt="img" height="auto" width="400px"></center>
			<p> On  21  September  1972,  Marcos  declared  martial  law  to  “save  the  republic  and  reform  our society.”    A  biography  of  the  president  justified  martial  law  by  saying  that  the  society,  “by  its unresponsiveness   to   popular   needs,   had   lost   the   right   to   exist.”   (Department   of   Public Information 1975, 150) To  help  Marcos  achieve  his  disciplined  new  society,  he  launched  a  massive  militarization campaign.    Military  membership  grew  from  55,000  in 1972  to  250,000  in  1984,  and  its  budget ballooned from P 608 million in 1972 to $ 8.8 billion in 1984.  Military personnel, especially his Ilocano  friends,  where  appointed  to  various  posts  in  government  and  civilian  bureaucracy (Nepomuceno-Francisco  and  Arriola  1987,  177).    The president’s  former  military  driver,  the loyal  Ilocano  General  Fabian  C.  Ver,  was  eventually  appointed  as  Chief  of  Staff  of  the  Armed Forces of the Philippines.  The military were given a free hand in implementing peace and order (Hamilton-Patterson 1998, 177, 301).  </p> 
			<p>Despite  seeming  peace  and  order  caused  by  Martial  Law  and  the  modernization  of  the  military and constabulary (police), beyond the high walls of military camps and the lights and glamor of censored television and broadcasting, lies a dark face of Martial Law.   Some  people  said,  there  were  horrible  things  happening  inside  the  camps.      President  Marcos denied them at first but when they become too many he said they were only isolated cases, and dismissed them as “aberrations” (Aquino 1984, 2000, 88-89). With  such  power  and  resources  given  to  the  military  to  “save”  democracy,  they  were  able  to commit a number of human rights violations.  And in stifling dissent, as Ninoy Aquino said, “in saving democracy, [Marcos] killed it.” </p>
		
		<h2> THE NUMBERS: HAIR-RAISING</h2>
<center><img src="9.jpg" alt="img" height="auto" width="400px"></center>
			<P> Statistics  on  the  extent  of  human  rights  violations  were  hair-raising.    Danilo  Vizmanos,  a  West Point-trained  Navy  Captain  turned  activist,  estimates  the  extent  of  suffering  under  martial  law:  7,000  victims  of  torture,  2,000 salvaged  or  summarily  executed,  1,000  people  disappeared (Malanes  1999,  16).    His  estimate  is  similar  to  the  number  of  legal  claimants  of  human  rights violations against the Marcoses in the Hawaii case:  9,539 (Rosales 1999, 12). In  addition  to  this,  the  Task  Force  Detainees  of  the  Philippines  gives  numbers  to  more  specific inicdences.  In their record, from 1965-1986, the numbers were as follows: </p>
			<p> 2,668 incidents of arrests   </P>
			<p>	306 total number of arrested individuals  </P>
			<p>	398 disappearances   </P>
			<p>	1,338 salvagings  </P>
			<p>	128 frustrated salvagings  </P>
			<p>	1,499 killed or wounded in massacres (Magsaysay 1999) </P>
			<p> But Amnesty International, 1977 Nobel Peace Prize recipient and respected activist organization on  global  human  rights,  gives  a  not  so  conservative  estimates  in  the  whole  Martial  Law  years:  70,000 were imprisoned, 34,000 were tortured, 3,240 were killed (Tiongson 1997). The numbers vary and it would be impossible to account for everything since some victims and their families chose not to pursue it for fear  for their lives.  Despite the differences in statistics, these are not just numbers.  Here are thousands of lives lost, and thousands of families destroyed.  The human rights violations happened, and they were real. </p>
		
		<h2> PSYCHOLOGICAL & EMOTIONAL TORTURE: "WHAT LONELINESS MEANT" </h2>
<center><img src="17.jpg" alt="img" height="auto" width="400px"></center>
			<P> To the regime, it was the “Army with a heart.”  But for the victims, it is far from the truth. Far from what they experienced. For a  VIP, someone from the opposition, a tycoon,  or even  some of their sons, detention might be the worst thing that can happen to them during Martial Law.  But since these leaders inspire dissent, the regime would instill psychological torture such as isolation to instill fear or to shake one’s principle. </p>
			<p> Senator  Ramon  Mitra  was  placed  under  solitary  confinement  for  about  a  hundred  days  with “nobody  to  talk  to,  just  by  yourself.”    He  would  be  awaken  at  about  1:00  AM  and  be  brought outside  his  cell  to  hear  the  sounds  of  gunfire,  and  then  he  was  returned  to  his  cell  and  told  to relax.    To  keep  his  sanity,  he  would  recite  poems  or  sing  songs,  and  the  soldier  at  one  point thought he was crazy (Delgado 1999, 14). Senators Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino and José “Pepe” Diokno were the first ones to be arrested the night  Martial  Law  was  implemented.    On  12  March  1973,  nearly  the  fifth  month  of  their detention, the two were blindfolded and flown to Fort  Magsaysay in Laur, Nueva Ecija.  Ninoy recounted, </p>
			<p> They...placed  me in a box.   I had only  my  brief and  my t-shirt.   I refused to eat because I thought they were poisoning me.  There was nothing in the room, barely nothing.  And I had nothing to do but twiddle my thumb, and for the first time in my life I heard the ticking of every second, and I was counting every second into minutes, and as the minutes marched into hours, and hours into days and days into weeks, I knew what loneliness meant. </p>
		<h2> PHYSICAL TORTURE:  NOT EVEN FOR ANIMALS </h2>
<center><img src="20.jpg" alt="img" height="auto" width="400px"></center>
			<p> If  you  were  not  as  lucky  to  be  born  with  a  silver  spoon,  like  ordinary  activists  and  even  some innocent  civilians,  you  get  arrested  without  warrant,  detained  illegally,  and  be  subjected  under extreme  physical  torture.    Even  in  prison,  Sen.  Ninoy  Aquino  collected  cases  of  torture  during the early years of Martial Law citing Amnesty International and the International Commission on Jurists  in  an  essay  entitled  “Evidence  Tortured  Into  Existence.”    (Aquino  1984,  2000,  89-105, 110-113). Many  of  the  cases  of  torture  and  illegal  detention happened  in  undisclosed safe  houses  and military camps.  In Metro Manila, detained activists joke about how they get locked in “ABC and back  to  B”—Camp  Emilio  Aguinaldo  (Quezon  City),  Camp  Bagong  Diwa  (Bicutan,  Taguig), Camp  Rafael  Crame  (Quezon  City)  and  Fort  Bonifacio (Taguig)  (Cervantes  2006,  2010)  or proceed  to  D—Death  (Canoy  1980,  65).    After  a  few  days,  they  would  be  confined  in  the military hospital or detained and kept incommunicado for long periods of time. </p>
			<p> The  listings  by  Ninoy  Aquino  and  Primitivo  Mijares (Aquino  1984,  2000,  89-105,  110-113; Mijares 1976, 276-324)  gives the names and  faces to the different techniques of torture.   Aside from deadly weapons, unassuming everyday items like water, pliers, thumb tacks, ball pens, flat iron were used to create constant and enduring pain that even time can hardly heal:  </p>
			<center> <h3> Electric  Shock </h3> </center>
			<p> one  of  the  frequently  used  techniques.    Usually,  the  electric  wires  were attached  to  fingers  and  the  genitalia  of  the  victim,  as  inflicted  on  Charlie  Revilla  Palma  and Wilfredo  Hilao.    Sometimes,  wires  were  attached  to the  arms  and  the  head,  just  like  what happened to Romeo Tolio.  Other victims were Reynaldo Guillermo, Alejandro Arellano, Victor Quinto,  Pedro  de  Guzman,  Jr.,  Reynaldo  Rodriguez,  Julius  Giron,  Armando  Teng,  Santiago Alonzo, Romeo Bayle and Agaton Topacio. </p>
			<center> <img src="11.jpg" style="width:620px;height:320px;"> </center>
			<center> <h3> San Juanico Bridge </h3> </center>
			<p> the  victim  lies  between  two  beds  and  if  his/her  body  falls  or  sags,  the victim  will  be  beaten.    This  was  just  one  of  the  many  tortures  inflicted  on  José  Lacaba  and Bonifacio Ilagan. </p>
			<center> <img src="12.jpg" style="width:620px;height:320px;"> </center>
			<center> <h3> Truth  Serum </h3> </center>
			<p> An injection administered in hospitals and used for interrogation, making a victim "talk drunkenly." Administered  at  the  V.  Luna  General  Hospital.    It made  José  Lacaba  “talk drunkenly.”  It was also administered to Victor Quinto. </p>
			<center> <img src="13.jpg" style="width:620px;height:320px;"> </center>
			<center> <h3> Russian Roulette</h3> </center>
			<p> the victim is forced to aim a revolver with a bullet at his/her own head and then  pull  the trigger.  This was used  to further  terrify Rev. Cesar Taguba  and Carlos Centenera while being subjected to other tortures.</p>
			<center> <img src="14.jpg" style="width:620px;height:320px;"> </center>
			<center> <h3> Beating</h3> </center>
			<p> another favorite technique where a group of soldiers would beat with “fists, kicks and karate  blows”  manacled  victims.    Almost  all  those  who  were  tortured  where  subjected  to  this beating, among them Julius Giron, Macario Tiu, Eugenio Magpantay, Joseph Gatus, Rev. Cesar Taguba,  Reynaldo  Guillermo,  Alejandro  Arellano,  Charley  Palma,  Victor  Quinto,  Pedro  de Guzman,  Jr.,  Reynaldo  Rodriguez,  Ma.  Cristina  Verzola,  Julius  Giron,  Armando  Teng,  Romeo Bayle, Agaton Topacio, Reynaldo Ilao and Ramon Casiple. </p>
			<center> <img src="15.jpg" style="width:620px;height:320px;"> </center>
			<center> <h3> Pistol-Whipping</h3> </center>
			<p> beating   with   rifle   butts;   one   of   the   techniques   endured   by   Reynaldo Guillermo, Roberto Sunga, Joseph Gatus and Nathan Quimpo. </p>
			<center> <img src="pw.jpg" style="width:620px;height:320px;"> </center>
			<center> <h3> Water Cure</h3> </center>
			<p>  another favorite technique.  Huge amounts of water would be forced through into the victim’s mouth, and  by beating would  be forced out.   This was applied to Guillermo  Ponce de Leon, Alfonso Abzagado and Andrew Ocampo. </p>
			<center> <img src="wc.jpg" style="width:620px;height:320px;"> </center>
			<center> <h3> Strangulation</h3> </center>
			<p> Done  by  hand,  electric  wire  and  steel  bar  to  Carlos  Centenera,  and  for  two months  his  speech  was  impaired.    Others  who  claimed  to  be  strangulated  were  Willie  Tatanis, Juan Villegas and Reynaldo Rodriguez. </p>
			<center> <img src="s.jpg" style="width:620px;height:320px;"> </center>
			<center> <h3> Cigar and flat iron burns </h3> </center>
			<p> Victims of torture are inflicted with burns using cigarettes, and even a flat iron, bonus  you  would  get  under  torture.    Received  by  Marcelino  Tolam,  Jr.,  Philip Limjoco, Charley Palma, Ma. Cristina Verzola and Reynaldo Rodriguez. Despite being old in his fifties, Cenon Sembrano’s foot was heated with a flat iron.  His foot became swollen and infected. </p>
			<center> <img src="b.jpg" style="width:620px;height:320px;"> </center>
			<center> <h3> Pepper Torture </h3> </center>
			<p> Meynardo Espeleta’s bonus was a “concentrated peppery substance placed on his lips and genitals.” </p>
			<center> <img src="pt.jpg" style="width:620px;height:320px;"> </center>
			<center> <h3> Animal  Treatment </h3> </center>
			<p> victims  are  manacled  and  caged  like  beasts.  For  three  days,  Leandro Manalo was caged inside a toilet handcuffed and blindfolded.  Because of the experience he got viral hepatitis.   For long periods of time,  manacles were not removed from Alexander Arevalo, Manuel   Daez,   Marcelo   Gallarin,   Romualdo   Inductivo, Faustino   Samonte   and   Rodolfo Macasalabang, even if they ate, discharged their waste, took baths or slept.    Food was given to them as if they were dogs, “shoved under the iron grilles.”  And they ate without even knowing what the food was because there were no lights in their cell.  Inductivo, despite his old age, was mercilessly  slapped  and  electrocuted  under  torture.    Rev.  Cesar  Taguba  was  made  to  drink  his urine.  And Monico Atienza, in his nakedness was threatened to be fed to dogs. </p>
